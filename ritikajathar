Hi! 
of course my hands and feet and my life is extremely chaotic and the exact polar opposite of the life that you live. 
I like to organize. or I like to think about organizing. until very recently, when i was trying to understand how to get rid of the caste system. 
lol!
I understood that any system of organization simply begins to discriminate and label things for easier use. 
productivity and relatability are the only "why's" organizations exist.
something in common across a scheme of things. this relates to that. thus this and this go together. 
assuming we take a picture like this. +

"trying to understand it, is a meaningless task" said my thatha./ thatha means grandpa in tamil. 
Thatha called me at 2pm. I was in a call. I had to send some files over to my clients. 
And thatha wanted me to come and meet him immediately. He was all dolled up in his favourite shirt and dhoti. and asked me why I had'nt brought the car to meet him.
I told him I did'nt want to go to my studio in a car. And suddenly he jumped with his stick and started walking towards me and he wanted to get on to the bike. 
I had to talk to him while I carefully made sure that the bike never bumped on the cracks on the roads. 
have you seen a guy's skin super close? like a guy that the world would consider ugly. A guy whose face is covered in acne. 
Well, Chennai's roads have more bumps and holes than his face. :P. I took my thatha to the post office.
while the whole office was trying to do what you would love to do. arrange things in cupboards. naming and coding letters. 
so that they reach other people. Also, letters are nice things. I grew up around letters. My mom works in the post office. 
Apparently all that my grandpa wanted to do was to watch my mom working.

I did not understand it then. 
I still do not know if i understood it. 
I still do not know why people do things. knowing is putting things on the cupboard ain't it?
lol!
All study and knowledge is simply that ain't it?
but putting things into box is what made things better and worse. 
Can feelings be put into boxes? 
Can this letter be put into boxes. 


lol. 


It is quite weird.
